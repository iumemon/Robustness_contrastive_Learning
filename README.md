# Robustness_contrastive_Learning
This repository contains the code for our experiments on evaluating the robustness of contrastive learning in font style classification. Our goal was to develop a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between different font styles compared to supervised classification. Contrastive learning has shown promising results.
